((1)) Read contents of input files into array of 2 elements, thats it,
each of two element contain another array inside. Separate elements from
files by newline.

Something like:

[array]{
  [0] => [array]{
    [0] => 'Lorem',
    [1] => 'ipsum',
    ...
    [68] => 'laborum'
  },
  [1] => [array]{
    [0] => 245,
    [1] => 23,
    ...
    [69] => 500
  }
}

((2)) Scan the array of words for the longest and shortest words.
You need only find the number values.
The longest there is - 13, the shortest is 2.

((3)) Create a string from concatenations of all words from array[0]
which starts with a || b || c || d || e.
After each word (even after the last one) you must put an underscore (_);

You can check the 'spell' in the results.txt.

((4)) Splice second sub array into 2 chunks of 35 elements.
Let's call those 2 arrays as slices.
Perform a square root taking on every pair sum of both slices.

E.g.:

cycle for every element with 'i' index {
  result[i] = sqrt ( slice1[i] * slice2[i] )
}

((5)) Calculate a sum of all resultive elements.

So:

foreach result as num {
  sum += num
}

((6)) Print runtime to the screen. Microseconds will do.

Example output: 0.000501...
