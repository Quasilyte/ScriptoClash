<h1>ScriptoClash!</h1>
<h3>Interpreted languages battle.</h3>

Runtime measured in microseconds.<br>
Accuracy is pretty low, but still, it's only another synthetic test,<br>
it proves nothing.<br>

Tests were run on 2 computers, both having Linux Mint as OS.<br>

*Lisp is the slowest. The different approaches are showing different<br>
results, but best I got so far is 0.0037 real time (vs 0.0016 on php).<br>
Just to mention, the most fair ways given x5 times worse outputs.<br>
